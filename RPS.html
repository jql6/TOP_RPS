    The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and
    computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner
    of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock". Make the function
    case insensitive. Examples include: rock, ROCK, RocK.

    winner or loser at the end. Use console.log() to display the results
    of each round and the winner at the end. Use prompt() to get input from
    the user.
